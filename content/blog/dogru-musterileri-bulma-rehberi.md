# Finding the Right Customers and Understanding Their Needs: The Key to Startup Success

**"Everyone can be my customer"** - The moment you hear this sentence, know that startup is doomed to fail. Because **the one who makes products for everyone has made products for no one**.

90% of successful startups have discovered the same truth: **Finding the right customer segment and understanding their real needs is more important than technical skills**.

## 🎯 Why Is Customer Focus So Critical?

### **Startup Statistics:**
- **42%** - Failure rate of startups that fail due to lack of customer need
